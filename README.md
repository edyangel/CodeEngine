   I want to create [describe what you want]
   ```

   - "Adapt this for a helmet enchantment"
   - "Add fire damage instead of bleeding"
   - "Make it work for Paper 1.20"
   - "Simplify it to only have life steal"

### Example Prompt

```
Read this CodeEngine sword enchantment:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/[username]/codeengine-docs/main/folia/1.21/weapons/sword/blade_of_condemned.yml

I want to create a pickaxe enchantment that:
- Gives speed when mining
- Has a 20% chance to drop bonus diamonds
- Adds particle effects
- Works on Folia 1.21

Please generate the complete YAML configuration following the same structure.
```

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

1. **Be specific** - Tell ChatGPT exactly what you want
2. **Reference the structure** - ChatGPT will follow the same pattern
3. **Ask for explanations** - Request comments in the code
4. **Iterate** - Ask ChatGPT to modify parts you don't like
5. **Test** - Always test on a development server first
